        "# Python tutorial\n",
        "Python is a very common programming language in machine learning applications and is used in the exercises of this course. This tutorial is targeted for students that have at least elementary knowledge of programming in any language. In particular, you should know basic concepts such as variables, loops and functions. In this document we see how to use those building blocks in Python programs. We also cover some important packages such as NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. If you installed the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (Python version 3.x recommended) you should already have those packages, in addition to the Python language itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notes:** 1) There are exercises in the end of this document. 2) A part of the tutorial uses the well-known Iris data set. You can download it [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/).\n",

        "## Jupyter Notebook\n",
        "Jupyter Notebook is an easy way to make documents containing both runnable program code and text (markdown). [Tutorials](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) about Jupyter Notebook are easily found on the Internet but we also cover some of the most important concepts here. \n",
        "\n",
        "Notebook documents consist of two kinds of *cells*: *code* and *Markdown*. Code cells contain executable program code and Markdown cells contain text, possibly with images. You can execute the currently selected cell by pressing either **Ctrl+Enter** or **Shift+Enter**. The latter option also selects the next cell, making it easy to execute multiple consecutive cells after each other. These actions can also be found in the menu: Cell -> Run Cells. The entire Notebook can be executed from the menu: Kernel -> Restart & Run All.\n",
        "\n",
        "To add a new cell, press either a (insert *above* the current cell) or b (*below* the current cell) when a cell is selected but not editable. When editing a cell, pressing a or b will of course just add a letter to the document. To stop editing a cell, you may click the border area. To delete a cell, press d (*delete*) *twice*. To turn a cell into a Markdown cell, press m. By pressing y the current cell becomes a code cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is possible to execute a cell multiple times or to execute cells in an order that is different from their order in the document. This can be handy when you need to make small changes - there is no need to re-execute everything from the beginning. However, you need to remember that the state of the running program is determined by the order in which you run the cells, not by their order in the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "By pressing h (*help*) you can see what keyboard shortcuts are available. You can also access everything from the menus but it is faster to memorize at least the most commonly used keyboard shortcuts such as adding and executing cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Python programming basics\n",
        "As our simplest use case, we can easily compute the values of certain expressions:"

For example, if A and B are 3x3-matrices, (A\\*B)[0, 0] = A[0]\\*B[0] whereas (A@B)[0, 0] = A[0, 0]\\*B[0, 0] + A[0, 1]\\*B[1, 0] + A[0, 2]\\*B[2, 0].\n",

        "Above, we used the operator \\* where the left-side object was a matrix, but on the right there was a vector. This works because of an automatically applied mechanism known as *broadcasting*. Conceptually, the vector [1, 2, 3] (here interpreted as a row vector) was repeated three times to get a 3x3-matrix with all rows equal to [1, 2, 3]. The matrix mat was then multiplied element-wise with this new matrix."
